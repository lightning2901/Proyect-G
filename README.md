A proyect about differences on videogame players between 2 videogames, HALO MCC and Battlefield 2042
First of all we have the graphics of each videogame.

The first one is Battlefield

And the next is Halo The Master Chief Collection

After, thanks to a webpage https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/ i was able to get the point of a graphic, and save it into a JSON wich is gonna be bellow, and get a CSV.
With those Files i was able to generate a graphic to compare both of them and see what the difference is.

Series 1 and 2 represent Battlefield, while 4 and 5 represent Halo.

As a conclusion,  got that Battlefield has a deficit from about 6 thousand players, those calculations are in the python file, with an explanation about how it works.

As we can see Halo's numbers are constant most of the time, and lately, they're growing, but the same can't be said for Battlefield.
