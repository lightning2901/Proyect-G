# Introduction
The objective of this project is to compare and see how it's been the behaviour between these 2 games, Battlefield being a new game that promised a lot, and Halo The Master Chief collection wich has 5 classic games from Halo Combat Evolved (2001) to Halo 4 (2012). The comparisno will show us the difference on the amount of players each month from january to the very last day of august in 2022. Both are FPS games with multiplayer online and with updates still going.


The first one is Battlefield

After, thanks to a webpage https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/ i was able to get the point of a graphic, and save it into a JSON wich is gonna be bellow, and get a CSV.
With those Files i was able to generate a graphic to compare both of them and see what the difference is.

# Conclusion
As a conclusion,  got that Battlefield has a deficit from about 6 thousand players, those calculations are in the python file, with an explanation about how it works.

As we can see Halo's numbers are constant most of the time, and lately, they're growing, but the same can't be said for Battlefield.
