A proyect about differences on videogame players between 2 videogames, HALO MCC and Battlefield 2042
First of all we have the graphics of each videogame.

The first one is Battlefield

And the next is Halo The Master Chief Collection

These images were taken fromm steamplayercount.com


After, thanks to a webpage https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/ i was able to get the point of a graphic, and save it into a JSON wich is gonna be bellow, and get a CSV.
With those CSV Files i was able to get them into Excel and generate a graphic to compare both of them and see what the difference is.

Series 1 and 2 represent Battlefield, while 4 and 5 represent Halo.

As we can see Halo's numbers are constant most of the time, and lately, they're growing, but the same can't be said for Battlefield.
